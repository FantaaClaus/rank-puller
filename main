This script assumes that the API you are working with returns data in JSON format with fields for username, platform, rank_2s, and rank_3s. Make sure to replace api_url with the actual API endpoint you want to use and adjust the database connection details accordingly.

Remember to install the required Python libraries using pip install requests and pip install sqlite3 if you haven't already. Also, replace the database connection details with your own if you're using a different database system.




User
please implement this api key into the code above: 74d6943a-6c9f-4db4-86b7-b75101d5a8ca

To include an API key in your requests to the API, you can add an "Authorization" header to the request with the API key value. Here's the modified Python script with the API key included:

python
Copy code
import requests
import sqlite3

# API endpoint URL
api_url = "https://api.example.com/player_data"

# Your API key
api_key = "74d6943a-6c9f-4db4-86b7-b75101d5a8ca"

# Database connection
conn = sqlite3.connect("player_data.db")
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Create the table if it doesn't exist
cursor.execute("""
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS player_data (
        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
        username TEXT NOT NULL,
        platform TEXT NOT NULL,
        rank_2s INTEGER,
        rank_3s INTEGER
    )
""")
conn.commit()

# Make the API request with the API key included in the headers
headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"
}
response = requests.get(api_url, headers=headers)

if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()

    # Iterate through the API data and insert it into the database
    for entry in data:
        username = entry["username"]
        platform = entry["platform"]
        rank_2s = entry["rank_2s"]
        rank_3s = entry["rank_3s"]

        # Insert the data into the database
        cursor.execute("""
            INSERT INTO player_data (username, platform, rank_2s, rank_3s)
            VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)
        """, (username, platform, rank_2s, rank_3s))
        conn.commit()

    print("Data successfully fetched and stored in the database.")

else:
    print(f"Failed to fetch data from the API. Status code: {response.status_code}")

# Close the database connection
conn.close()
